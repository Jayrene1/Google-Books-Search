## About 
This is a MERN stack Heroku-hosted website that allows users to search the Google Books API. Results are displayed with book titles, images, authors, descriptions, and links to Google Books. Users can save book information to the Mongo database, and find saved books on the "saved" navigation tab. Users may also delete books from the mongo database.
